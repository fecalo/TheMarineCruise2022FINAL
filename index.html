	<p>Marine ecosystems are the largest of Earth's aquatic ecosystems and exist in waters that have a high salt content.
	Marine waters cover more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and account for more than 97% of Earth's water supply and 90% of habitable space on Earth.
	Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The OCEANIC ZONE is the vast open part of the ocean
	where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live. The BENTHIC ZONE consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The INTERTIDAL 
	ZONE is the area between high and low tides. Other NEAR-SHORE (NERITIC) ZONES can include mudflats, seagrass meadows, mangroves, rocky intertidal 
	systems, salt marshes, coral reefs, lagoons.</p>

	<p>Oceanic Zone - The oceanic zone is typically defined as the area of the ocean lying beyond the continental shelf, but operationally is often referred to as beginning where the water depths drop to below 200 meters (660 feet), seaward from the coast into the open ocean.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Benthic Zone - The benthic zone is the ecological region at the lowest level of a body of water such as an ocean, lake, or stream, including the sediment surface and some sub-surface layers.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Intertidal Zone - The intertidal zone, also known as the foreshore, is the area above water level at low tide and underwater at high tide (in other words, the area within the tidal range).</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Near-Shore (Neritic Zone) - The neritic zone (or sublittoral zone) is the relatively shallow part of the ocean above the drop-off of the continental shelf, approximately 200 meters (660 ft) in depth.</p>
